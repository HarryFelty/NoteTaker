# NoteTaker

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate how to set up a server in order to handle requests from a client. It was also created to solve the problem of needing a reliable note-taking app to help keep track things. This project uses various technologies, most notable the use of server side technologies. This allows the app to send the appropriate response based upon the client's request. I learned much about these technologies and gained a better understanding of how the client-server relationship works.
